To put it simply, ***Suzpack Light*** is a minecraft resourcepack. 
It adds many beautiful changes and improvements to the game.
From gorgeous custom skies, to perfect randomly rotated and tileable grass textures; this pack has it all.

**Suzpack is no longer under constant development and 1.13.2, 1.14.4, and 1.15.2 versions will not be released**


****▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁**
**Here's a list of some (a small percentage) of the features that suzpack adds to the game**
**▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔****

-Low fire and shields for better visibility.

-Clearer and quieter rain.

-Beautiful water with custom colors and transparency that dynamically changes based on the biome you're in.

-Opaque and un-obtrusive "underwater texture" so visibility isn't poor, as is normally the case in minecraft.

-"Normal" textures for blocks with added depth and detail. Each block texture is 64x64 (with a few exceptions) 
and all those extra pixels are put to good use. "depth" is added to every block with shading and small divots that
make minecraft come alive. The same textures you love now with a wonderful twist.

-Glass is now super clear, no more ugly windows. More vivid colors and better than ever visibility. 
Connected textures ensure all your builds are as sleek as the skills used to create them.

-3D models for many blocks including but not limited to: ladders, rails, reeds, furnaces, and doors.

-All new gui with many little tweaks and changes that make the game easier on the eyes and overall more beautiful.

-Greener grass using a custom colormap. Grass also transitions more smoothly from biome to biome.

-Biome colormaps that change the environment colors subtly leading to a more immersive playing experience.

-Mob blinking animations and smaller eyes. This breathes life into your game and the creatures living in it.

-Removed pumpkin blur and "java edition" text.

-Custom skies with stunning sunsets like you've never seen.

-Animated crops and grass.

-Quieter sounds. Nether portals, villagers, dispensers, and pistons are all less annoying and quieter.

-Animated ores and lights

-Old damage sound

-Smaller cursor

-Smooth fonts in vanilla and even better ones in optifine

-Dyes that don't just look like lose powder

-Many more that I don't want to type cause it's 2 am.
